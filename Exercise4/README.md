`python ../bin/es.py -f acrobot.ini -g bestgS1.npy -p`

The tool is documented in [How to Train Robots through Evolutionary and Reinforcement Learning Methods](https://bacrobotics.com/Chapter13.html) which includes also a detailed tutorial with excercises.

For an introduction to the theory and to state-of-the-art research in this areas, see the associated open-access book [Behavioral and Cognitive Robotics: An Adaptive Perspective](https://bacrobotics.com)
